## Notes

- As per the requirement of good SEO, performance and scalability, an SSR approach was taken.
- Some security and accessibility best practices were taken into account, but no extensive implementation in this areas was made due to time constrains.
- The design specs are not comprehensive so some assumtions were made in regard to fonts, dimensions, etc.
